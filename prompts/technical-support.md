               netsh winsock reset
               netsh int ip reset
               ipconfig /release
               ipconfig /renew
               ipconfig /flushdns
               ```
               - Run Command Prompt as administrator and enter these commands
               - Restart your computer after running them

            11. Change wireless channel settings:
               - Access your router's admin page (typically 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)
               - Look for wireless settings and try changing the channel
               - 5GHz channels typically have less interference than 2.4GHz

            ### Alternative Solutions

            If the above doesn't resolve the issue:

            - Check for WiFi adapter hardware issues by testing with a USB WiFi adapter
            - Try creating a new network profile:
              1. Forget your current network
              2. Reconnect and set up as a new network
            - Consider checking for BIOS updates related to power management or networking
