<examples>
    <example>
        <input>
            I'm 35 years old and just received a $50,000 inheritance. I have $20,000 in credit card debt at 18% interest, $30,000 in student loans at 5%, a mortgage, and I'm contributing 5% to my 401(k) with a 4% employer match. What should I do with the inheritance?
        </input>
        <output>
            Here's my recommendation for your $50,000 inheritance, based on financial best practices:

            ## Priority Plan for Your Inheritance

            1. **Pay off high-interest credit card debt: $20,000**
               * This debt costs you 18% annually, which is significantly higher than reasonable investment returns
               * Paying this off immediately saves you approximately $3,600 in interest in the first year alone
               * This is effectively an 18% guaranteed return on your money

            2. **Establish/strengthen emergency fund: $15,000**
               * This provides 3-6 months of essential expenses (assuming $2,500-$5,000 monthly expenses)
               * Keep this in a high-yield savings account (currently earning 3-5%)
               * This protects you from future credit card debt if unexpected expenses arise

            3. **Increase 401(k) contribution: $0 upfront, but adjust your contribution**
               * You're currently leaving money on the table with a 5% contribution and 4% match
               * Increase your contribution to at least 8% to capture the full employer match
               * This is an immediate 50% return on the additional 3% you contribute

            4. **Remaining $15,000 allocation options:**
               * Option A: Make a lump sum payment on student loans
                 * Accelerates debt freedom and saves interest at 5%
                 * Provides psychological benefit of reducing total debt burden
               * Option B: Invest for longer-term goals
                 * If retirement is underfunded, add to retirement accounts
                 * If you have medium-term goals (house down payment, etc.), invest appropriately for that timeline
               * Option C: Balanced approach
                 * $7,500 to student loans
                 * $7,500 to investments aligned with your goals

            ## Rationale for This Approach

            This plan follows fundamental financial principles:
            1. Eliminate high-interest debt first (guaranteed 18% return)
            2. Establish financial security through emergency savings
            3. Maximize "free money" from employer matching
            4. Balance remaining priorities based on interest rates and personal goals

            ## Additional Considerations

            * **Tax implications:** The inheritance itself is likely not taxable income, but verify this with a tax professional
            * **Student loan consideration:** If these are federal loans, consider current repayment programs before making extra payments
            * **Investment approach:** Any funds allocated to investments should be diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon

            Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan or discuss how to implement these steps in more detail?

            I'm 28 years old making $65,000/year as a teacher. I have $45,000 in student loans at 6.8% interest, $5,000 in credit card debt, and $10,000 in savings. I'm currently renting but want to buy a house in the next 3-5 years. I contribute 6% to my pension plan which is mandatory. What should my financial priorities be?

        <output>
            # Financial Priority Plan for a 28-Year-Old Teacher

            Based on your situation, here's a strategic financial plan that balances debt reduction with preparing for homeownership:

            ## Current Financial Snapshot
            - **Income**: $65,000/year (approximately $4,000/month after tax)
            - **Student Loans**: $45,000 at 6.8% interest
            - **Credit Card Debt**: $5,000 (likely at 15-25% interest)
            - **Savings**: $10,000
            - **Retirement**: 6% mandatory pension contribution
            - **Goal**: Homeownership in 3-5 years

            ## Immediate Priorities (Next 6 Months)

            1. **Eliminate Credit Card Debt**
               * This high-interest debt is likely costing you $750-1,250 annually
               * Allocate $1,000-1,500/month to eliminate this debt within 3-5 months
               * Consider a balance transfer card with 0% intro APR if your credit score permits

            2. **Establish a True Emergency Fund**
               * Keep $6,000 (approximately 1.5 months of expenses) as your emergency reserve
               * This provides basic financial security while you address high-interest debt
               * Keep this in a high-yield savings account separate from your house fund

            3. **Begin Student Loan Optimization**
               * Verify if you qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) as a teacher
               * If eligible, switch to an income-driven repayment plan immediately
               * If not eligible for forgiveness, continue making regular payments while addressing other priorities

            ## Medium-Term Strategy (6-24 Months)

            4. **Accelerate Student Loan Repayment**
               * If not pursuing loan forgiveness, increase monthly payments by $300-500
               * Target highest interest loan groups first (debt avalanche method)
               * Each $10,000 reduced saves you $680 annually in interest

            5. **Build Your House Down Payment Fund**
               * Begin contributing $500-700/month to your house fund
               * Keep this separate from your emergency fund
               * For a 3-5 year timeline, consider a mix of high-yield savings and conservative investments:
                 - 70% in high-yield savings/CDs
                 - 30% in conservative ETFs or bond funds

            6. **Supplement Retirement Savings**
               * Open a Roth IRA and contribute $100-200/month initially
               * Increase this amount after credit card debt is eliminated
               * This supplements your pension and provides tax diversification

            ## Long-Term Considerations (2+ Years)

            7. **Increase House Fund Contributions**
               * After credit card debt is eliminated, redirect those payments to your house fund
               * Aim for a 10-20% down payment plus closing costs ($30,000-60,000 depending on home prices in your area)

            8. **Develop a Student Loan Endgame**
               * If not pursuing forgiveness, aim to eliminate student loans before taking on mortgage debt
               * If pursuing PSLF, maximize retirement contributions instead of making extra loan payments

            9. **Expand Financial Protection**
               * Review insurance coverage (renters, disability, life if you have dependents)
               * Consider an umbrella policy as your net worth grows

            ## Monthly Cash Flow Allocation (Suggested)

            | Category | Amount | Percentage |
            |----------|--------|------------|
            | Housing (rent, utilities) | $1,400 | 35% |
            | Other Essential Expenses | $1,000 | 25% |
            | Credit Card Debt Payment | $1,000 | 25% |
            | Student Loan Payment | $300 | 7.5% |
            | House Fund | $200 | 5% |
            | Discretionary Spending | $100 | 2.5% |

            *After credit card debt is eliminated, redirect that $1,000 to: House Fund ($600), Student Loans ($200), Roth IRA ($200)*

            ## Teacher-Specific Opportunities

            - **403(b) Options**: Check if your school offers supplemental retirement options
            - **Teacher Loan Forgiveness**: Explore federal programs specifically for educators
            - **Summer Income**: Consider summer teaching opportunities to accelerate debt payoff
            - **Teacher Housing Programs**: Research if your area offers special mortgage programs for educators

            Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this plan or adjust it based on additional details about your situation?

            # Retirement Readiness Assessment

            ## Current Financial Position
            - **Retirement Assets**: $850,000 (70% stocks/30% bonds)
            - **Cash Reserves**: $150,000
            - **Home Equity**: $500,000 (paid off)
            - **Current Annual Expenses**: $70,000
            - **Expected Social Security**: $35,000/year at age 65
            - **Time Horizon**: 7 years until retirement

            ## Retirement Projection Analysis

            ### Income Needs Assessment
            - Current expenses: $70,000/year
            - Less Social Security: $35,000/year
            - **Annual shortfall to cover from portfolio**: $35,000

            ### Retirement Portfolio Sustainability
            Using the 4% withdrawal rule as a starting benchmark:
            - Sustainable annual withdrawal from $850,000: $34,000/year
            - With Social Security: $69,000/year total income
            - This is slightly below your current spending of $70,000

            However, with 7 more years of potential growth and contributions:
            - Assuming a conservative 5% annual return, your portfolio could grow to approximately $1.2 million by retirement
            - This would support $48,000/year using a 4% withdrawal rate
            - Combined with Social Security: $83,000/year total income
            - This provides a comfortable buffer above your current spending

            ## Strengths of Your Current Position

            1. **Strong Asset Base**: Your current savings represent approximately 12× your annual expenses
            2. **Debt-Free Home**: Eliminating housing debt significantly reduces retirement income needs
            3. **Substantial Cash Reserve**: Your $150,000 cash position provides excellent financial security
            4. **Balanced Asset Allocation**: Your 70/30 portfolio is appropriate for your age and time horizon

            ## Recommended Adjustments

            ### 1. Portfolio Optimization
            - **Consider a Glide Path Approach**: Gradually adjust to 60% stocks/40% bonds by retirement
            - **Implement in Phases**: Shift approximately 1.5% from stocks to bonds annually over the next 7 years
            - **Tax-Efficient Rebalancing**: Make these adjustments through new contributions and required distributions rather than selling appreciated assets when possible

            ### 2. Cash Position Strategy
            - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain $35,000-$50,000 (6-9 months of expenses) in high-yield savings
            - **Short-Term CD Ladder**: Allocate $50,000-$75,000 to a 1-3 year CD ladder for better returns while maintaining liquidity
            - **Portfolio Boost**: Consider investing $25,000-$50,000 of excess cash in your retirement allocation to enhance long-term growth

            ### 3. Social Security Optimization
            - **Delayed Filing Analysis**: Evaluate whether delaying Social Security beyond 65 makes sense for either spouse
            - Each year of delay increases benefits by approximately 8%
            - For the higher-earning spouse, delaying to age 70 could significantly increase survivor benefits

            ### 4. Tax Planning Opportunities
            - **Roth Conversion Strategy**: Consider converting portions of traditional retirement accounts to Roth during these final working years
            - Target conversion amounts that keep you within your current tax bracket
            - This creates tax diversification and reduces future RMDs

            ### 5. Retirement Expense Planning
            - **Detailed Budget Projection**: Develop a more detailed retirement budget that accounts for:
              - Healthcare costs (approximately $300,000 per couple throughout retirement)
              - Travel or lifestyle changes in early retirement
              - Reduced expenses in certain categories (commuting, work clothes)
              - Home maintenance reserve for your paid-off property

            ## Next Steps

            1. **Retirement Income Plan**: Develop a specific withdrawal strategy that coordinates:
               - Which accounts to draw from first
               - How to manage tax implications
               - When to claim Social Security

            2. **Healthcare Bridge Strategy**: If retiring before Medicare eligibility at 65, plan for health insurance coverage

            3. **Estate Planning Review**: Ensure your will, powers of attorney, and beneficiary designations are current

            4. **Long-Term Care Consideration**: Evaluate whether long-term care insurance or self-funding makes sense for your situation

            Based on this analysis, you appear to be on track for retirement with some optimizations recommended. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this assessment or provide more detailed calculations for your retirement projections?

            # Financial Foundation Plan for New Graduate

            Congratulations on your first job! Here's a strategic plan to build a strong financial foundation while balancing student loan repayment and taking advantage of your current low living expenses.

            - **Other Debt**: None mentioned
            - **Savings**: Not specified

            ## Monthly Income Breakdown (Estimated)

            | Net Monthly Income | $3,000 |

            ## Priority Action Plan (First 90 Days)

            ### 1. Capture Full Employer Match
            - **Immediate Action**: Enroll in 401(k) with 6% contribution
              * This reduces your monthly take-home pay by approximately $180
              * Your employer adds $90/month (50% match)
              * This is an immediate 50% return on investment
            
            ### 2. Build Emergency Fund
            - **Target**: $6,000-$9,000 (3-6 months of basic expenses once you move out)
            - **Initial Goal**: Save $3,000 (1 month of income) within first 3 months
            - **Where to Keep It**: High-yield savings account (currently earning 3-5%)

            ### 3. Establish Student Loan Repayment Strategy
            - **Standard Repayment**: Approximately $260/month for 10 years
            - **Consider**: Income-driven repayment if you qualify and expect income growth
            - **Verify**: Whether loans are federal or private (affects repayment options)

            ## Medium-Term Strategy (Months 4-12)

            ### 4. Increase Emergency Fund
            - Continue building until you reach $6,000-$9,000
            - Accelerate this goal while living with parents

            ### 5. Start Additional Retirement Savings
            - Once emergency fund reaches $3,000, open a Roth IRA
            - Contribute $100-200/month initially
            - Increase as other goals are met

            ### 6. Develop Moving-Out Fund
            - If planning to move out within 1-2 years, start a dedicated savings fund
            - Target: First/last month's rent, security deposit, furniture, moving expenses
            - Typical need: $3,000-$6,000 depending on your location

            ## Suggested Monthly Budget While Living with Parents

            | Category | Amount | Percentage |
            |----------|--------|------------|
            | 401(k) Contribution | $240 | 8% (pre-tax) |
            | Parents Contribution/Rent | $300-500 | 10-17% |
            | Student Loan Payment | $260 | 9% |
            | Transportation | $200-300 | 7-10% |
            | Personal Expenses | $300-400 | 10-13% |
            | Emergency Fund Building | $1,000 | 33% |
            | Additional Savings | $500-700 | 17-23% |

            ## Long-Term Considerations (Year 2+)

            ### 7. Housing Transition Strategy
            - **Before Moving Out**: Have emergency fund complete + moving fund
            - **Housing Budget Guideline**: Keep housing costs under 30% of take-home pay
            - **Roommate Consideration**: Sharing housing can significantly accelerate other financial goals

            ### 8. Student Loan Acceleration
            - After emergency fund is complete and you're settled in housing, consider accelerating loan payments
            - Each $100/month extra payment saves approximately $1,200 in interest and pays off loans 2 years earlier

            ### 9. Career Development Investment
            - Set aside funds for skills development, certifications, or further education
            - This often provides the best long-term return through income growth

            ## Advantage of Your Current Situation

            Your living situation provides a unique opportunity to build financial security rapidly. If you can maintain reasonable expenses while living with your parents for 12 months, you could potentially:

            - Build complete emergency fund ($6,000-9,000)
            - Establish retirement savings ($4,000+ between 401(k) and Roth IRA)
            - Create moving-out fund ($3,000-6,000)
            - Make standard payments on student loans ($3,120)
            - Total financial progress: $16,000-22,000+ in one year

            ## Next Steps

            1. **Enroll in your employer's 401(k) plan** this week to start capturing the match
            2. **Open a high-yield savings account** for your emergency fund
            3. **Create a simple tracking system** for your spending and saving goals
            4. **Review your student loan details** to understand all repayment options
