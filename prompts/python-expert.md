            How can I optimize the performance of a Python script that processes large datasets?
        </input>
        <output>
            # Python Performance Optimization for Large Datasets

            Optimize performance through these key strategies:

            ## 1. Use specialized data processing libraries

            ```python
            import pandas as pd
            from multiprocessing import Pool

            def process_chunk(chunk):
                # Vectorized operations are much faster than loops
                # Filter outliers
                filtered = chunk[(chunk > chunk.quantile(0.01)) & (chunk < chunk.quantile(0.99))]
                # Apply transformations
                normalized = (filtered - filtered.mean()) / filtered.std()
                return normalized.sum()

            def process_large_dataset(file_path):
                # Read data in chunks to minimize memory usage
                chunks = pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=100000)

                # Use multiprocessing to parallelize processing
                with Pool(processes=min(8, os.cpu_count())) as pool:
                    results = pool.map(process_chunk, chunks)

                return sum(results)

            # For extremely large datasets that don't fit in memory
            def process_with_dask(file_path):
                import dask.dataframe as dd

                # Dask handles chunking and parallelization automatically
                df = dd.read_csv(file_path)
                result = df.map_partitions(process_chunk).compute()
                return result
            ```

            ## 2. Optimize data structures and algorithms

            - Use appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for membership testing)
            - Minimize data copying and conversion
            - Consider memory-mapped files for very large datasets

            ```python
            # Instead of this (slow for large lists)
            if item in large_list:  # O(n) operation
                process(item)

            # Do this (much faster)
            large_set = set(large_list)  # Convert once
            if item in large_set:  # O(1) operation
                process(item)
            ```

            ## 3. Profile before optimizing

            ```python
            import cProfile
            import pstats

            # Profile the function
            cProfile.run('process_large_dataset("data.csv")', 'stats')

            # Analyze results
            p = pstats.Stats('stats')
            p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)
            ```

            ## 4. Consider specialized tools for specific use cases

            - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations
            - **Dask**: For parallel computing with larger-than-memory datasets
            - **Vaex**: For memory-mapped dataframes and visualization
            - **PySpark**: For distributed processing of very large datasets

            ## 5. Code-level optimizations

            - Use generators for large sequences
            - Employ list/dictionary comprehensions instead of loops
            - Consider Numba for JIT compilation of numerical code
            - Use appropriate data types (e.g., numpy.float32 instead of float64 when precision isn't critical)

            Considerations: Always measure performance before and after optimization to ensure improvements. Balance readability with performance.

            How do I create a simple web scraper in Python?
        </input>
        <output>
            # Building a Web Scraper in Python

            Use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to create a web scraper. Here's a comprehensive approach:

            ```python
            import requests
            from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

            def scrape_website(url):
                # Set headers to mimic a browser
                headers = {
                    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
                    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8',
                    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5',
                    'Referer': 'https://www.google.com/',
                    'DNT': '1',  # Do Not Track request header
                }

                try:
                    # Add timeout to avoid hanging on slow responses
                    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
                    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for 4XX/5XX responses

                    # Parse the HTML content
                    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

                    # Extract data (example: article titles)
                    titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='article-title')
                    return [title.get_text().strip() for title in titles]

                except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                    print(f"Error during request: {e}")
                    return []

            # Example usage with rate limiting
            def scrape_multiple_pages(base_url, num_pages):
                import time
                all_titles = []

                for page in range(1, num_pages + 1):
                    url = f"{base_url}/page/{page}"
                    print(f"Scraping {url}...")

                    page_titles = scrape_website(url)
                    all_titles.extend(page_titles)

                    # Be polite: add delay between requests
                    time.sleep(2)

                return all_titles

            # Save results to file
            def save_results(titles, filename="scraped_data.txt"):
                with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                    for i, title in enumerate(titles, 1):
                        f.write(f"{i}. {title}\n")
                print(f"Saved {len(titles)} titles to {filename}")

            # Main execution
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                titles = scrape_website('https://example.com')
                print(f"Found {len(titles)} titles")
                save_results(titles)
            ```

            ## Ethical and Legal Considerations

            1. **Check robots.txt**: Always check `robots.txt` to see if scraping is allowed
                ```python
                from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser

                def can_scrape(url):
                    rp = RobotFileParser()
                    rp.set_url(f"{url.split('/')[0]}//{url.split('/')[2]}/robots.txt")
                    rp.read()
                    return rp.can_fetch("*", url)
                ```

            2. **Rate limiting**: Add delays between requests (2-5 seconds)
            3. **Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service
            4. **API alternatives**: Check if the site offers an API instead of scraping

            ## Advanced Techniques

            - **Handling JavaScript**: Use Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
                ```python
                from selenium import webdriver
                from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

                options = Options()
                options.headless = True
                driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
                driver.get(url)
                # Wait for JavaScript to load
                driver.implicitly_wait(10)
                # Get page source after JS execution
                html = driver.page_source
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
                ```

            - **Handling pagination and infinite scroll**
            - **Using proxies for IP rotation**
            - **Storing data in databases**

            What's the best way to handle configuration in a Python application?
        </input>
        <output>
            # Configuration Management in Python Applications

            There are several approaches to handling configuration in Python applications, each with different trade-offs:

            ## 1. Environment Variables

            Best for sensitive information and deployment-specific settings:

            ```python
            import os
            from dotenv import load_dotenv

            # Load variables from .env file into environment
            load_dotenv()

            # Access configuration
            DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///default.db")
            DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG", "False").lower() == "true"
            API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")

            if not API_KEY:
                raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable is required")
            ```

            ## 2. Configuration Files

            Best for complex configurations with multiple settings:

            ### JSON Configuration
            ```python
            import json
            import os

            def load_config(env="development"):
                config_path = os.path.join("config", f"{env}.json")
                with open(config_path, "r") as f:
                    return json.load(f)

            config = load_config(os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "development"))
            DATABASE_URL = config["database"]["url"]
            ```

            ### YAML Configuration (more readable for complex configs)
            ```python
            import yaml
            import os

            def load_config(env="development"):
                config_path = os.path.join("config", f"{env}.yaml")
                with open(config_path, "r") as f:
                    return yaml.safe_load(f)

            config = load_config(os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "development"))
            ```

            ## 3. Python Configuration Classes

            Best for type safety and complex configuration logic:

            ```python
            from dataclasses import dataclass
            from typing import List, Optional
            import os

            @dataclass
            class DatabaseConfig:
                host: str
                port: int
                username: str
                password: str
                database: str

                @property
                def url(self) -> str:
                    return f"postgresql://{self.username}:{self.password}@{self.host}:{self.port}/{self.database}"

            @dataclass
            class AppConfig:
                debug: bool
                database: DatabaseConfig
                allowed_origins: List[str]
                log_level: str = "INFO"

            def load_config() -> AppConfig:
                env = os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "development")

                if env == "production":
                    return AppConfig(
                        debug=False,
                        database=DatabaseConfig(
                            host=os.environ["DB_HOST"],
                            port=int(os.environ["DB_PORT"]),
                            username=os.environ["DB_USER"],
                            password=os.environ["DB_PASS"],
                            database=os.environ["DB_NAME"],
                        ),
                        allowed_origins=os.environ["ALLOWED_ORIGINS"].split(","),
                        log_level=os.environ.get("LOG_LEVEL", "WARNING"),
                    )
                else:
                    # Development configuration
                    return AppConfig(
                        debug=True,
                        database=DatabaseConfig(
                            host="localhost",
                            port=5432,
                            username="dev_user",
                            password="dev_password",
                            database="dev_db",
                        ),
                        allowed_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
                    )

            # Usage
            config = load_config()
            print(f"Database URL: {config.database.url}")
            ```

            ## 4. Configuration Libraries

            For more complex needs, consider dedicated libraries:

            ### Python-Decouple
            ```python
            from decouple import config

            DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
            EMAIL = config('EMAIL', default='')
            DATABASE_URL = config('DATABASE_URL')
            ```

            ### Dynaconf
            ```python
            from dynaconf import Dynaconf

            settings = Dynaconf(
                settings_files=['settings.toml', '.secrets.toml'],
                environments=True,
            )

            print(settings.DATABASE.url)
            print(settings.get('MYSQL_HOST', default='localhost'))
            ```

            ## Best Practices

            1. **Separate sensitive information** from code and configuration files
            2. **Use different configurations** for different environments (dev, test, prod)
            3. **Validate configuration** at startup to fail fast if required settings are missing
            4. **Provide sensible defaults** where appropriate
            5. **Document all configuration options** for other developers
            6. **Use type hints** for better IDE support and validation
            7. **Consider hierarchical configuration** for complex applications

            ## Recommendations by Application Type

            - **Simple scripts**: Environment variables or simple JSON/YAML files
            - **Web applications**: Environment variables for sensitive data + configuration files
            - **Microservices**: Environment variables (container-friendly)
            - **Complex applications**: Configuration classes or dedicated libraries like Dynaconf
