            How can I find the maximum subarray sum in an array of integers?
        </input>
        <output>
            # Maximum Subarray Sum Problem

            ## Step 1: Understanding and Visualization

            Let's understand the problem with an example array: `[−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4]`

            We need to find a contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

            Visualizing some subarrays and their sums:
            - `[−2]` → sum = -2
            - `[1]` → sum = 1
            - `[4, −1, 2, 1]` → sum = 6
            - `[−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4]` (entire array) → sum = 1

            **Edge cases to consider:**
            - Empty array → return 0 (or handle as specified)
            - All negative numbers → return the largest (least negative) number
            - All positive numbers → return the sum of the entire array

            Let's visualize the optimal subarray in our example:

            ```
            Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
            Value: -2   1  -3   4  -1   2   1  -5   4
                                ↑___________↑
                                Optimal subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] with sum = 6
            ```

            ## Step 2: Brute Force Approach

            The simplest approach is to consider all possible subarrays and find the one with the maximum sum:

            ```python
            def max_subarray_brute_force(nums):
                if not nums:
                    return 0

                max_sum = float('-inf')
                n = len(nums)

                for start in range(n):
                    current_sum = 0
                    for end in range(start, n):
                        current_sum += nums[end]
                        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

                return max_sum
            ```

            **Time Complexity:** O(n²) - We have two nested loops
            **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space

            This works but is inefficient for large arrays. Let's optimize it.

            ## Step 3: Optimization

            We can use **Kadane's Algorithm**, which is an efficient way to solve this problem in O(n) time:

            **Key insight:** At each position, we have two choices:
            1. Start a new subarray at the current element
            2. Extend the previous subarray by including the current element

            We choose whichever gives a larger sum.

            **Algorithm steps:**
            3. Initialize two variables: `max_current` and `max_global` to the first element
            4. Iterate through the array starting from the second element
            5. For each element, update `max_current` to be the maximum of:
                - The current element (starting a new subarray)
                - The current element plus `max_current` (extending the previous subarray)
            6. Update `max_global` if `max_current` becomes larger
            7. Return `max_global` as the result

            ## Step 4: Implementation

            Here's the implementation of Kadane's Algorithm:

            ```python
            def max_subarray_sum(arr):
                # Handle empty array case
                if not arr:
                    return 0

                max_current = max_global = arr[0]
                for num in arr[1:]:
                    max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
                    max_global = max(max_global, max_current)
                return max_global
            ```

            Alternative implementation in JavaScript:

            ```javascript
            function maxSubarraySum(nums) {
                if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

                let maxCurrent = nums[0];
                let maxGlobal = nums[0];

                for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
                    maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
                    if (maxCurrent > maxGlobal) {
                        maxGlobal = maxCurrent;
                    }
                }

                return maxGlobal;
            }
            ```

            ## Step 5: Testing

            Let's test our solution with various cases:

            **Test Case 1:** Our example array
            ```
            Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

            Trace through the algorithm:
            Initialize: max_current = max_global = -2

            num = 1:
                max_current = max(1, -2 + 1) = max(1, -1) = 1
                max_global = max(-2, 1) = 1

            num = -3:
                max_current = max(-3, 1 + (-3)) = max(-3, -2) = -2
                max_global = max(1, -2) = 1

            num = 4:
                max_current = max(4, -2 + 4) = max(4, 2) = 4
                max_global = max(1, 4) = 4

            num = -1:
                max_current = max(-1, 4 + (-1)) = max(-1, 3) = 3
                max_global = max(4, 3) = 4

            num = 2:
                max_current = max(2, 3 + 2) = max(2, 5) = 5
                max_global = max(4, 5) = 5

            num = 1:
                max_current = max(1, 5 + 1) = max(1, 6) = 6
                max_global = max(5, 6) = 6

            num = -5:
                max_current = max(-5, 6 + (-5)) = max(-5, 1) = 1
                max_global = max(6, 1) = 6

            num = 4:
                max_current = max(4, 1 + 4) = max(4, 5) = 5
                max_global = max(6, 5) = 6

            Output: 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])
            ```

            **Test Case 2:** All negative numbers
            ```
            Input: [-1, -2, -3, -4]
            Output: -1 (the largest single element)
            ```

            **Test Case 3:** All positive numbers
            ```
            Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
            Output: 10 (the entire array)
            ```

            **Test Case 4:** Empty array
            ```
            Input: []
            Output: 0 (as per our implementation)
            ```

            ## Step 6: Analysis

            **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We only need to iterate through the array once
            **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space

            **Optimality:** This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity.

            **Interview Tips:**
            8. Mention that this is a classic dynamic programming problem
            9. Explain the intuition behind Kadane's algorithm clearly
            10. Discuss how you're handling edge cases (empty array, all negative numbers)
            11. If asked, be prepared to extend the solution to also return the start and end indices of the maximum subarray

            **Follow-up Questions You Might Be Asked:**
            12. How would you modify the algorithm to find the maximum product subarray?
            13. How would you solve this in a circular array (where the subarray can wrap around)?
            14. Can you solve this using a divide-and-conquer approach? (Hint: similar to merge sort)

            # System Design: URL Shortening Service

            ## Step 1: Requirements Clarification

            ### Functional Requirements:
            1. **URL Shortening**: Convert a long URL to a short URL
            2. **URL Redirection**: Redirect users to the original URL when they access the short URL
            3. **Custom Short URLs**: Allow users to create custom short URLs (optional)
            4. **Analytics**: Track click rates and other metrics (optional)
            5. **Link Expiration**: Set expiration dates for URLs (optional)

            ### Non-Functional Requirements:
            6. **High Availability**: The service should be highly available
            7. **Low Latency**: Redirection should happen with minimal delay
            8. **Scalability**: The system should handle high traffic volumes
            9. **Security**: Prevent abuse and malicious URL shortening

            ### Capacity Estimation:
            - **Traffic estimates**: 
                - 100 million URLs generated per month
                - 10:1 read-to-write ratio (1 billion redirects per month)
            - **Storage estimates**:
                - Each entry: ~1KB (URL, short code, user data, timestamps)
                - 100 million URLs/month × 1KB = 100GB/month
                - 5 years retention: 6TB
            - **Bandwidth estimates**:
                - Write: 100 million × 1KB = 100GB/month
                - Read: 1 billion × 0.5KB = 500GB/month

            ## Step 2: High-Level Design

            ### API Design:

            1. **URL Shortening**:
                ```
                POST /api/shorten
                {
                    "original_url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url/that/needs/shortening",
                    "custom_alias": "custom" (optional),
                    "expiration_date": "2023-12-31" (optional)
                }

                Response:
                {
                    "short_url": "https://short.url/abc123",
                    "expiration_date": "2023-12-31",
                    "status": "success"
                }
                ```

            2. **URL Redirection**:
                ```
                GET /{short_code}

                Response: HTTP 302 Redirect to original URL
                ```

            3. **Analytics (Optional)**:
                ```
                GET /api/stats/{short_code}

                Response:
                {
                    "short_code": "abc123",
                    "original_url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url",
                    "creation_date": "2023-01-15",
                    "total_clicks": 10342,
                    "referrers": {"Google": 5123, "Twitter": 2500, ...},
                    "browsers": {"Chrome": 6789, "Firefox": 2345, ...},
                    "devices": {"Mobile": 7890, "Desktop": 2452, ...}
                }
                ```

            ### Components:

            4. **Application Service**:
                - Handles API requests
                - Generates short URLs
                - Manages redirections

            5. **Database**:
                - Stores mappings between short codes and original URLs
                - Stores user data and analytics

            6. **Cache**:
                - Stores frequently accessed URLs to reduce database load

            7. **Analytics Service** (Optional):
                - Processes and stores click data
                - Generates reports

            ### System Architecture Diagram:

            ```
            User → DNS → Load Balancer → Application Servers → Cache → Database
                                                ↓
                                        Analytics Service
            ```

            ## Step 3: Detailed Component Design

            ### URL Shortening Algorithm:

            **Option 1: Hash-based Approach**
            8. Hash the original URL using MD5 or SHA-256
            9. Encode the hash using Base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
            10. Take the first 6-8 characters as the short code

            **Potential issue**: Hash collisions
            **Solution**: Check for collisions and rehash or append a counter

            **Option 2: Counter-based Approach**
            11. Maintain a global counter
            12. For each new URL, increment the counter
            13. Convert the counter to Base62

            **Potential issue**: Predictable URLs
            **Solution**: Add randomization or encryption

            **Implementation (Counter-based with Base62 encoding)**:

            ```python
            import string

            # Characters for Base62 encoding
            CHARS = string.ascii_letters + string.digits  # a-z, A-Z, 0-9

            def encode(counter):
                """Convert a decimal counter to Base62 encoding."""
                if counter == 0:
                    return CHARS[0]

                result = ""
                base = len(CHARS)

                while counter > 0:
                    result = CHARS[counter % base] + result
                    counter //= base

                return result

            def generate_short_code(counter):
                """Generate a short code from a counter."""
                return encode(counter)
            ```

            ### Database Schema:

            **URLs Table**:
            ```
            id: bigint (primary key)
            short_code: varchar(10) (indexed)
            original_url: text
            user_id: bigint (foreign key, optional)
            creation_date: timestamp
            expiration_date: timestamp (optional)
            is_custom: boolean
            ```

            **Clicks Table** (for analytics):
            ```
            id: bigint (primary key)
            url_id: bigint (foreign key)
            click_time: timestamp
            user_agent: text
            referrer: text
            ip_address: varchar(45)
            ```

            ### Caching Strategy:

            - Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed URLs
            - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
            - Cache size: ~20% of daily active URLs

            ## Step 4: Scaling and Optimization

            ### Database Scaling:

            **Partitioning**:
            - **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)**:
                - Shard by short_code (e.g., first character)
                - Consistent hashing for even distribution

            **Replication**:
            - Master-slave replication for read scalability
            - Multiple read replicas across regions

            ### Application Scaling:

            - Stateless application servers for horizontal scaling
            - Load balancing using round-robin or least connections
            - Deploy in multiple regions with CDN integration

            ### Optimization Techniques:

            1. **Bloom Filters**:
                - Reduce database lookups for non-existent URLs
                - Quick check if a URL might exist before database query

            2. **Caching Layers**:
                - Browser caching with appropriate HTTP headers
                - CDN caching for static resources
                - Application-level caching for hot URLs

            3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
                - Use message queues for analytics processing
                - Batch database writes for click data

            ## Step 5: Security and Edge Cases

            ### Security Considerations:

            4. **Rate Limiting**:
                - Prevent abuse by limiting requests per user/IP
                - Implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms

            5. **URL Validation**:
                - Check for malicious URLs
                - Validate URL format and accessibility

            6. **Data Privacy**:
                - Encrypt sensitive data
                - Comply with data protection regulations

            ### Edge Cases:

            7. **Custom Collision**:
                - Handle when a requested custom short code already exists

            8. **URL Length Limits**:
                - Set maximum length for original URLs

            9. **Expiration Handling**:
                - Periodic cleanup of expired URLs
                - Graceful handling of expired URL access

            10. **Concurrent Requests**:
                - Ensure atomicity for counter increments
                - Handle race conditions in URL creation

            ## Step 6: Additional Features (Optional)

            11. **QR Code Generation**:
                - Generate QR codes for short URLs

            12. **API Authentication**:
                - Implement OAuth or API keys for service access

            13. **User Dashboard**:
                - Allow users to manage their shortened URLs

            14. **Advanced Analytics**:
                - Geographic distribution of clicks
                - Time-based click patterns

            ## Interview Tips

            15. **Clarify Requirements First**:
                - Ask about scale, features, and constraints before diving into design

            16. **Discuss Trade-offs**:
                - Explain pros and cons of different approaches
                - Justify your design choices

            17. **Focus on Core Functionality**:
                - Prioritize the URL shortening and redirection mechanisms
                - Add advanced features only after covering the basics

            18. **Be Ready to Adapt**:
                - Interviewer might introduce new constraints mid-discussion
                - Show flexibility in adjusting your design

            19. **Quantify Your Design**:
                - Use concrete numbers for storage, traffic, and latency
                - Demonstrate capacity planning skills

            ## Company-Specific Considerations

            Different companies might focus on different aspects of this system design:

            - **Google/Meta**: Expect deep questions on scalability and distributed systems
            - **Amazon**: May focus on reliability, fault tolerance, and cost optimization
            - **Microsoft**: Might emphasize security and enterprise features
            - **Startups**: May care more about time-to-market and feature flexibility

            Remember that system design interviews assess your ability to make trade-offs and justify decisions, not just your knowledge of specific technologies.

            How would you implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with a fixed capacity?
        </input>
        <output>
            # Implementing an LRU Cache

            ## Step 1: Understanding and Visualization

            An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is a data structure that maintains a fixed-size collection of items, discarding the least recently used item when the cache reaches capacity and a new item needs to be added.

            **Key operations:**
            1. `get(key)`: Retrieve a value from the cache and mark it as recently used
            2. `put(key, value)`: Add or update a key-value pair in the cache, evicting the least recently used item if at capacity

            **Example visualization:**

            Let's say we have an LRU cache with capacity 3:
            ```
            Initial state: Empty cache []
            
            put(1, 'A') → [1:'A']
            put(2, 'B') → [2:'B', 1:'A']  (2 is most recent)
            put(3, 'C') → [3:'C', 2:'B', 1:'A']  (3 is most recent)
            
            get(1) → Returns 'A' and moves 1 to most recent → [1:'A', 3:'C', 2:'B']
            
            put(4, 'D') → Cache is full, evict least recent (2) → [4:'D', 1:'A', 3:'C']
            
            get(2) → Returns null (not found)
            ```

            **Edge cases to consider:**
            - Accessing a non-existent key
            - Updating an existing key
            - Cache with capacity 0 or 1
            - Concurrent access (thread safety)

            ## Step 2: Brute Force Approach

            A simple approach would be to use an array or list to store key-value pairs, moving accessed items to the front:

            ```python
            class LRUCacheBrute:
                def __init__(self, capacity):
                    self.capacity = capacity
                    self.cache = []  # List of (key, value) pairs
                
                def get(self, key):
                    for i, (k, v) in enumerate(self.cache):
                        if k == key:
                            # Move to front (most recently used)
                            self.cache.pop(i)
                            self.cache.insert(0, (k, v))
                            return v
                    return -1  # Not found
                
                def put(self, key, value):
                    # Check if key exists and remove it
                    for i, (k, _) in enumerate(self.cache):
                        if k == key:
                            self.cache.pop(i)
                            break
                    
                    # Add new key-value pair to front
                    self.cache.insert(0, (key, value))
                    
                    # Evict least recently used if over capacity
                    if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
                        self.cache.pop()
            ```

            **Time Complexity:**
            - `get(key)`: O(n) - need to search through the list
            - `put(key, value)`: O(n) - need to search and potentially remove existing key

            **Space Complexity:** O(capacity) - stores up to `capacity` key-value pairs

            This approach works but is inefficient for large caches due to linear search time.

            ## Step 3: Optimization

            To optimize our solution, we need O(1) operations for both `get` and `put`. We can achieve this by combining two data structures:

            1. **Doubly Linked List**: To maintain order of usage (most recent to least recent)
            2. **Hash Map**: For O(1) lookups by key

            **Key insight:** The hash map will store references to nodes in the linked list, allowing us to:
            - Quickly find a node by key
            - Move a node to the front of the list in O(1) time
            - Remove the least recently used node (tail of the list) in O(1) time

            ## Step 4: Implementation

            Here's an optimized implementation in Python:

            ```python
            class Node:
                def __init__(self, key, value):
                    self.key = key
                    self.value = value
                    self.prev = None
                    self.next = None

            class LRUCache:
                def __init__(self, capacity):
                    self.capacity = capacity
                    self.cache = {}  # Map key to node
                    
                    # Initialize dummy head and tail nodes
                    self.head = Node(0, 0)  # Most recently used
                    self.tail = Node(0, 0)  # Least recently used
                    self.head.next = self.tail
                    self.tail.prev = self.head
                
                def _remove_node(self, node):
                    # Remove node from current position
                    prev_node = node.prev
                    next_node = node.next
                    prev_node.next = next_node
                    next_node.prev = prev_node
                
                def _add_to_front(self, node):
                    # Add node right after head (most recently used)
                    node.prev = self.head
                    node.next = self.head.next
                    self.head.next.prev = node
                    self.head.next = node
                
                def get(self, key):
                    if key in self.cache:
                        node = self.cache[key]
                        
                        # Move to front (mark as recently used)
                        self._remove_node(node)
                        self._add_to_front(node)
                        
                        return node.value
                    return -1  # Not found
                
                def put(self, key, value):
                    # If key exists, update value and move to front
                    if key in self.cache:
                        self._remove_node(self.cache[key])
                    
                    # Create new node
                    node = Node(key, value)
                    self.cache[key] = node
                    self._add_to_front(node)
                    
                    # Evict least recently used if over capacity
                    if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
                        # Remove least recently used (node before tail)
                        lru_node = self.tail.prev
                        self._remove_node(lru_node)
                        del self.cache[lru_node.key]
            ```

            Here's the same implementation in Java:

            ```java
            import java.util.HashMap;
            import java.util.Map;

            class LRUCache {
                private class Node {
                    int key;
                    int value;
                    Node prev;
                    Node next;
                    
                    Node(int key, int value) {
                        this.key = key;
                        this.value = value;
                    }
                }
                
                private final int capacity;
                private final Map<Integer, Node> cache;

                private final Node tail;  // Least recently used
                
                public LRUCache(int capacity) {
                    this.capacity = capacity;
                    this.cache = new HashMap<>();
                    
                    // Initialize dummy head and tail nodes
                    this.head = new Node(0, 0);
                    this.tail = new Node(0, 0);
                    head.next = tail;
                    tail.prev = head;
                }
                
                private void removeNode(Node node) {
                    Node prev = node.prev;
                    Node next = node.next;
                    prev.next = next;
                    next.prev = prev;
                }
                
                private void addToFront(Node node) {
                    node.prev = head;
                    node.next = head.next;
                    head.next.prev = node;

                        Node lruNode = tail.prev;
                        removeNode(lruNode);
                        cache.remove(lruNode.key);
                    }
                }
            }
            ```

            ## Step 5: Testing

            Let's test our implementation with the example from earlier:

            ```
            LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(3);  // Capacity = 3
            
            cache.put(1, 'A');
            // Cache: [1:'A']
            
            cache.put(2, 'B');
            // Cache: [2:'B', 1:'A']
            
            cache.put(3, 'C');
            // Cache: [3:'C', 2:'B', 1:'A']
            
            cache.get(1);  // Returns 'A'
            // Cache: [1:'A', 3:'C', 2:'B']
            
            cache.put(4, 'D');
            // Cache: [4:'D', 1:'A', 3:'C']  (2:'B' is evicted)
            
            cache.get(2);  // Returns -1 (not found)
            ```

            **Edge Cases:**

            1. **Empty Cache:**
            ```
            LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(0);
            cache.put(1, 'A');  // Nothing added due to 0 capacity
            cache.get(1);  // Returns -1
            ```

            2. **Updating Existing Key:**
            ```
            LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(2);
            cache.put(1, 'A');
            cache.put(1, 'X');  // Update value of key 1
            cache.get(1);  // Returns 'X'
            ```

            3. **Capacity 1:**
            ```
            LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(1);
            cache.put(1, 'A');
            cache.put(2, 'B');  // Evicts 1:'A'
            cache.get(1);  // Returns -1
            cache.get(2);  // Returns 'B'
            ```

            ## Step 6: Analysis

            **Time Complexity:**
            - `get(key)`: O(1) - Hash map lookup and linked list operations are constant time
            - `put(key, value)`: O(1) - Hash map operations and linked list manipulations are constant time

            **Space Complexity:** O(capacity) - Stores up to `capacity` key-value pairs in both the hash map and linked list

            **Optimality:** This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity for an LRU cache.

            **Interview Tips:**

            1. **Discuss the trade-offs:**
                - The optimized solution uses more complex code but achieves O(1) operations
                - The brute force approach is simpler but inefficient for large caches

            2. **Mention thread safety:**
                - This implementation is not thread-safe
                - For concurrent access, you would need synchronization or thread-safe collections

            3. **Discuss potential extensions:**
                - Adding a time-based expiration policy alongside LRU
                - Implementing size-based eviction (e.g., for caching large objects)
                - Adding statistics tracking (hit rate, miss rate)

            **Follow-up Questions You Might Be Asked:**

            4. How would you make this implementation thread-safe?
            5. How would you implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache instead?
            6. How would you handle cache invalidation based on time expiry?
            7. How would you scale this to a distributed cache system?

            **Real-world Applications:**

            - Browser caches
            - Database query caches
            - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
            - Operating system page caches
            - Application-level caching (e.g., Memcached, Redis)
