<best_practices>
    1. Be as specific and detailed as possible in your prompts. Provide plenty of context, background information, and constraints so the AI clearly understands what you are asking for. Specify the desired format (e.g., a detailed report, bulleted list, narrative story, etc.), length, level of detail, tone, and writing style. The more specific guidance you can provide, the more likely the AI will generate an output that matches your needs. Vague or open-ended prompts lead to the AI having to make guesses or assumptions.
    2. Provide relevant examples to steer the AI in the right direction. Showing the model a few samples of the type of output you are looking for, whether that's a particular writing style, data format, or content structure, helps clarify your expectations. The AI will attempt to generate responses that mimic the patterns and qualities of the examples you provide. Well-chosen examples are a powerful technique to guide the model.
    3. For data analysis or quantitative prompts, include the actual data you want the AI to work with, ideally formatted in a clear, structured way with column headers, etc. Provide the source and date of the data if relevant. The more concrete data points the AI has to work with, the more nuanced and precise insights it can generate. Putting data directly in the prompt is usually more effective than just describing it.
    4. Explicitly spell out the format, structure, and elements you want included in the AI's output. If you need specific sections, headings, data visualizations, or content types included, state that clearly in the prompt. Tell the AI if you want a high-level summary versus an in-depth analysis. Specify your preferences for things like paragraph lengths, bulleted lists, including examples/quotes, linking to sources, etc. The AI will do its best to match the output template you request.
    5. Frame your prompts in terms of what you want the AI to do, rather than what not to do. Positive instructions are easier for the model to follow than negative ones. For example, instead of saying "don't write more than 500 words," say "please provide a response of roughly 500 words." Instead of "avoid technical jargon," say "use simple language suitable for a general audience."
    6. Assigning the AI a role, persona, or point-of-view to write from can help generate responses tailored for a specific audience or context. Prompt the AI with something like "Answer as if you were a [subject matter expert / persona]" or "Imagine you are writing [a memo to the CEO / a blog post for new parents / an article for Scientific American]." Framing the task from a particular vantage point guides the model to use the appropriate tone, style, and terminology for that scenario.
    7. For complex analysis or problem-solving, prompt the AI to show its work and outline its reasoning process. "Chain-of-thought prompting," where you ask the model to break down its logic step-by-step, can lead to more reliable and transparent outputs, since you can evaluate the underlying reasoning, not just the final answer. This allows you to spot gaps, faulty assumptions, or leaps of logic more easily.
    8. Similarly, break down large, complex queries into a series of smaller, simpler prompts where needed. If a task requires multiple steps (e.g., 1. research a topic, 2. outline an essay, 3. write the intro paragraph), prompt the AI for each step individually, using the output of one step to inform the next. This incremental approach is often more effective than a single sprawling prompt. It allows you to course-correct along the way.
    9. Be aware of the limitations of the AI model you are working with. Today's models have significant knowledge gaps, can get facts wrong, and may "hallucinate" incorrect statements. They can also reflect biases and inconsistencies from their training data. Don't expect the AI to have expert-level knowledge, to cite sources, or to do things beyond their design like accessing real-time information. Calibrate your prompts to work around these constraints.
    10. Approach prompting as an iterative process. Experiment with different phrasings, instructions, and examples to see how the model responds. Vary the level of specificity and detail you provide. Identify what types of prompts yield the best results for your particular use case. If a prompt doesn't hit the mark, don't hesitate to rephrase and try again. Prompting is a skill that gets better with practice!
    11. Provide the model with any reference text, existing content, or background material you want it to draw from to answer the prompt, if feasible to include. The more related information the AI has access to, the higher quality and more substantive its generated content is likely to be.
    12. Try "few-shot learning" - include a few examples of the kind of output you want directly in the prompt itself. Seeing a pattern helps prime the model to follow the same structure. This is especially useful for generating things like product reviews, meeting agendas, interview questions, etc., where showing a template makes the desired format crystal clear.
    13. Iterate and refine your prompts based on the initial outputs you get back. If the model doesn't quite hit the mark on the first attempt, don't give up. Instead, tweak your instructions to be even clearer and more specific about what you want. Scrutinize the output to see where the model may have been confused or led astray by ambiguous or missing information in the original prompt. Prompting is often a multi-step process to zero in on an ideal response.
    14. Don't be afraid to go through multiple prompt-response cycles with the AI to drill deeper into a topic or to refine an output. You can use the model's initial answer to inform your next prompt, e.g., by asking follow-up questions, requesting more detail on certain points, or suggesting changes and improvements to the generated content. The AI can be a powerful brainstorming partner in an iterative creative process.
    15. Anthropomorphizing the AI and giving it an avatar/visual representation can sometimes help make prompting more intuitive and natural for users and make the interaction feel more like a human conversation. Some people find it easier to prompt an AI agent they visualize as a distinct character or entity. Experiment to see if this 'priming' makes a difference for you.
    16. Consider the specific capabilities and limitations of different AI models. Some models excel at creative writing while others are better at analytical tasks. Tailor your prompts to leverage the strengths of the particular model you're using.
    17. Use clear demarcation between different parts of your prompt. Formatting elements like headers, bullet points, and numbered lists help the AI parse and understand the structure of your request.
    18. For creative tasks, consider providing both positive guidance (what you want) and negative guidance (what to avoid) to help steer the AI away from common pitfalls while encouraging desired qualities.
    19. When working with specialized domains (medicine, law, programming, etc.), include domain-specific terminology and frameworks in your prompts to elicit more accurate and relevant responses.
    20. Test your prompts with different variations to identify which formulations consistently produce the best results, especially for prompts you plan to use repeatedly.

                        Article excerpt: Recent studies have shown that remote workers experience both benefits and challenges compared to their office-based counterparts. A 2023 survey of 5,000 professionals found that remote workers reported 22% higher job satisfaction and 18% lower stress levels. However, they also experienced 15% more difficulty with collaboration and 27% felt more isolated from colleagues. Organizations implementing hybrid models, where employees split time between remote and office work, saw the highest overall employee satisfaction scores, with 74% of employees preferring this arrangement over fully remote (58%) or fully in-office (42%) options. Successful hybrid implementations typically include structured in-office days for collaboration, clear communication protocols, and investment in digital collaboration tools.

                - Do not make unfounded claims that go beyond what the data supports.
                - Clearly distinguish between correlation and causation.
                - Acknowledge limitations in the data or analysis when present.
                - Avoid unnecessary technical jargon when simpler explanations suffice.
                - Do not include introductory preambles or concluding statements about your role.
                - Focus only on generating the analysis output, not meta-commentary about the process.

                        # E-Commerce Sales Analysis

                        ## Key Findings
                        • Marketing spend shows a strong positive correlation with sales (correlation coefficient: 0.97), suggesting effective marketing campaigns
                        • Sales demonstrate clear seasonality with Q4 (Nov-Dec) showing 47% higher revenue than Q1
                        • Average conversion rate (sales per visitor) is $3.45, with highest efficiency in December ($3.33) and lowest in February ($3.63)

                        ## Sales and Marketing Trends

                        [Chart: Monthly Sales and Marketing Spend Visualization]

                        The data reveals a consistent relationship between marketing spend and sales performance. For every $1,000 increase in marketing budget, sales increased by approximately $8,300 on average. The return on marketing investment (ROMI) is approximately 730%, indicating highly effective marketing campaigns.

                        ## Seasonal Patterns

                        Sales follow a clear seasonal pattern:
                        • Q1 (Jan-Mar): $46,033 average monthly sales
                        • Q2 (Apr-Jun): $53,200 average monthly sales (↑15.6% from Q1)
                        • Q3 (Jul-Sep): $62,433 average monthly sales (↑17.4% from Q2)
                        • Q4 (Oct-Dec): $70,667 average monthly sales (↑13.2% from Q3)

                        The holiday season (Nov-Dec) shows particularly strong performance, with December sales 88.7% higher than January sales.

                        ## Visitor Conversion Analysis

                        Website traffic strongly correlates with both marketing spend (0.99) and sales (0.98). The average revenue per visitor remained relatively stable throughout the year, ranging from $3.33 to $3.63, suggesting consistent conversion optimization.

                        ## Recommendations

                        1. Consider increasing marketing budget given the strong ROMI
                        2. Implement seasonal marketing strategies with higher investment during Q4
                        3. Maintain current conversion optimization strategies as they appear effective

                        ## Methodology

                        This analysis used correlation analysis, time series decomposition, and ROMI calculations. Seasonality was assessed by quarterly comparison of mean values. Limitations include the absence of data on specific marketing channels and potential external factors affecting sales beyond marketing efforts.
