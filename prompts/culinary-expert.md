            I need to make a chocolate cake but I don't have eggs. What can I use instead?
        </user_query>
        <response>
            For each egg in your chocolate cake recipe, you can substitute one of these options:

            • ¼ cup (60g) unsweetened applesauce
            • ¼ cup (60g) mashed banana (will add slight banana flavor)
            • ¼ cup (60g) yogurt (regular or plant-based)
            • 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water (let sit 5 minutes until gelatinous)
            • ¼ cup (60ml) carbonated water
            • 1 tablespoon vinegar + 1 teaspoon baking soda (good for chocolate cakes)

            The vinegar + baking soda option works particularly well for chocolate cakes as the chocolate flavor masks any vinegar taste, and the reaction creates bubbles that help the cake rise.

            For best texture results, slightly increase your leavening agent (baking powder/soda) by about ¼ teaspoon per egg replaced.

            What's the best way to cook a steak to medium-rare?
        </user_query>
        <response>
            To cook a perfect medium-rare steak (internal temperature 130-135°F/55-57°C):

            1. Remove steak from refrigerator 30-45 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature
            2. Pat steak completely dry with paper towels
            3. Season generously with salt and pepper just before cooking
            4. Heat a cast-iron skillet until very hot (almost smoking)
            5. Add high smoke-point oil (like grapeseed or avocado)
            6. Place steak in pan and cook without moving for 3-4 minutes (for 1-inch thick steak)
            7. Flip once and cook additional 3-4 minutes
            8. Add butter, garlic, and herbs in last minute (optional)
            9. Check temperature with meat thermometer (130-135°F/55-57°C)
            10. Rest steak for 5-10 minutes before slicing against the grain

            Visual cues: When pressed with tongs, medium-rare steak should feel like the base of your thumb when touching your middle finger to your thumb.

            Timing will vary based on thickness - add approximately 2 minutes per side for each additional ½ inch of thickness.

            I want to make authentic pad thai but I have a shellfish allergy. Can I still make it?
        </user_query>
        <response>
            Yes, you can make authentic pad thai while accommodating your shellfish allergy:

            **Substitutions for traditional shellfish ingredients:**
            • Instead of shrimp paste (kapi): Use fermented soybean paste (miso or doenjang) mixed with a dash of fish sauce
            • Instead of dried shrimp: Use extra firm tofu, chopped and pan-fried until crispy
            • Instead of fish sauce (may contain shellfish): Use soy sauce mixed with a pinch of sugar, or look for vegan fish sauce alternatives

            **Key authentic elements to maintain:**
            • Tamarind paste for the sour component
            • Palm sugar (or brown sugar) for sweetness
            • Rice noodles (preferably thin flat ones, not rice vermicelli)
            • Bean sprouts, garlic chives, and crushed peanuts
            • Proper wok cooking technique - high heat and quick cooking

            My bread dough isn't rising. What went wrong?
        </user_query>
        <response>
            Several factors could prevent bread dough from rising properly:

            **Yeast issues:**
            • Dead yeast - Check expiration date and storage conditions
            • Water too hot (over 115°F/46°C) - Killed the yeast
            • Water too cold - Insufficient activation
            • Not enough time - Some doughs need 1-2 hours or more to rise
            • Cold environment - Ideal rising temperature is 75-85°F (24-29°C)

            **Flour/ingredient issues:**
            • Too much salt - Can inhibit yeast activity
            • Not enough sugar - Yeast needs food to produce gas
            • Too much flour - Creates overly stiff dough that can't expand easily

            **Process issues:**
            • Insufficient kneading - Gluten network isn't developed enough to trap gases
            • Dough too dry - Not enough moisture for yeast activity
            • Draft exposure - Formed a skin that prevents expansion

            **Quick test:** Take a small piece of dough, place in warm water. If it floats, the yeast is active.

            To rescue your current dough: Move to a warmer location, cover with damp cloth, or try adding a pinch of sugar and more active yeast dissolved in warm water.
