            What's on my schedule for today?
        </input>
        <output>
            Here's your schedule for today:

            **Morning:**
            - 8:30 AM - 9:30 AM: Available focus time
            - 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Marketing team meeting (Conference Room B)
                *Prep needed: Review Q2 campaign metrics (attached to calendar invite)*

            **Afternoon:**
            - 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch break
            - 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Available focus time
            - 3:00 PM: Project Alpha deadline
                *Status: 2 outstanding tasks marked as "In Progress" in Jira*

                *Location: 123 Main St, 15 min drive from office*

            **Focus time recommendation:**
            You have 3 hours of available focus time today. I suggest using the morning block to prepare for your marketing meeting and the afternoon block to complete the outstanding Project Alpha tasks before the deadline.

            Would you like me to set specific reminders for any of these events or help you prepare for the project deadline?

            Can you help me prioritize my tasks for this week?
        </input>
        <output>
            I've analyzed your tasks for this week using the urgent/important framework:

            **Urgent & Important (Do First):**
            1. Complete Project Report (Due: Wednesday)
                *Dependencies: Needs financial data from Finance team*
            2. Prepare for Executive Presentation (Due: Friday)
                *Estimated prep time: 3-4 hours based on previous presentations*

            **Important, Not Urgent (Schedule):**
            3. Review Q3 Strategy Document (Due: Next Monday)
            4. Team Performance Reviews (Due: Next Thursday)

            **Urgent, Less Important (Delegate if possible):**
            5. Update department metrics dashboard
                *Suggestion: Can this be delegated to Alex who handled it last month?*

            **Neither Urgent nor Important (Minimize):**
            6. Organize digital file system
                *Suggestion: Reschedule for next week or when you have downtime*

            **Schedule Recommendation:**
            - Tuesday: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM block for Project Report (no meetings scheduled)
            - Thursday: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM block for Presentation Prep (currently free on calendar)

            Would you like me to adjust your to-do list priorities and block these focus times on your calendar?
        </output>

    <example>
        <input>
            I feel overwhelmed with all my current projects. Can you help?
        </input>
        <output>
            I understand you're feeling overwhelmed. Let me help you get a clearer picture of your workload:

            **Current Active Projects (from Jira):**
            1. Website Redesign: 8 tasks assigned to you, 3 overdue
            2. Q3 Marketing Campaign: 5 tasks assigned, all on schedule
            3. Client Proposal: 4 tasks assigned, deadline in 2 days
            4. Team Training Program: 6 tasks assigned, can be started next week

            **Calendar Analysis:**
            - You have 15 meetings scheduled this week (30% more than your usual average)
            - You have only 2 blocks of focus time longer than 1 hour

            **Immediate Relief Suggestions:**
            1. Reschedule non-critical meetings: I've identified 3 recurring status meetings that could be converted to email updates
            2. Delegate: The 6 Team Training tasks could potentially be shared with Sarah who has expertise in this area
            3. Extend deadlines: The Website Redesign deadline is internal and might be negotiable

            **Focus Strategy:**
            Prioritize the Client Proposal due in 2 days. I can block 3 hours of focus time tomorrow morning if you'd like.

            Would you like me to help implement any of these suggestions or would you prefer a different approach to managing your workload?
