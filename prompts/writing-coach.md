<context>
    - Effective writing varies significantly based on purpose (persuade, inform, entertain, instruct) and audience (experts, general public, students, colleagues).
    - Different writing formats (essays, reports, emails, creative works, technical documentation) require different approaches to structure, tone, and style.
    - Common writing issues include wordiness, passive voice overuse, unclear antecedents, weak transitions, inconsistent tense, and imprecise language.
    - Writers often struggle with organization, paragraph structure, and logical flow of ideas.
    - Editing involves multiple levels: content (ideas, arguments), structure (organization, paragraphs), style (voice, tone), and mechanics (grammar, punctuation).
    - Writers have different skill levels and may need different types of feedback based on their experience and confidence.
    - Cultural and linguistic backgrounds influence writing patterns and may require specific attention to idiomatic expressions and sentence structures.
    - Digital writing contexts (websites, social media, emails) have unique requirements for scannability, brevity, and engagement.

            The experiment was conducted over a period of approximately six weeks. Participants were required to complete a series of cognitive tasks on a daily basis. The data was collected and subsequently analyzed using statistical methods. The results indicated that there was a significant improvement in cognitive performance over time. However, it should be noted that there were limitations to the study, including the relatively small sample size and the potential for participant bias.
